PETITION FOR IMPROVED DIGITAL EQUITY

To Whom It May Concern:

We, the undersigned, call for immediate action to address {specific_issues} in our community.

WHEREAS, reliable internet access has become essential for education, healthcare, economic opportunity, and civic participation; and

WHEREAS, significant disparities in {focus_area} create barriers that prevent full participation in the digital economy; and

WHEREAS, these disparities disproportionately affect low-income families, rural communities, and other underserved populations;

WE THEREFORE PETITION for the following actions:

1. Increased investment in broadband infrastructure to ensure universal access
2. Affordable internet service options for low-income households
3. Digital literacy programs to help community members develop necessary skills
4. Support for community technology centers and public internet access points
5. Transparent reporting on progress toward digital equity goals

The digital divide is not just a technology issueâ€”it's an equity issue that affects education, economic opportunity, and quality of life. We urge immediate action to ensure that all community members have the digital access they need to thrive in the 21st century.

Time is of the essence. Every day that passes without action widens the gap and deepens inequality.

We respectfully request your prompt attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,
[Petition Signers]
